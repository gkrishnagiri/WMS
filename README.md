# Enterprise Operations Suite (EOS)

Enterprise Operations Suite is the demo application for the AI-Native AMS
Research Platform. Phase 1 established the reusable backend and frontend
foundation, and Prompt 03 adds the first controlled warehouse transaction workflow.

## Current phase

Prompt 03 — Warehouse Transaction Workflows.

The application includes a FastAPI API, React/MUI application shell, request
IDs, structured logging, configuration, PostgreSQL and Redis connectivity
checks, and the Warehouse & Fulfillment domain model. Prompt 03 adds the
controlled path from customer order through allocation, pick and pack task
completion, shipment confirmation, inventory reduction, and an auditable
inventory transaction ledger. Allocation and shipment operations are atomic.

## Infrastructure status

The existing Phase 0 baseline remains the source of truth and is unchanged:

- PostgreSQL on host port `15432`
- Redis on host port `6379`
- OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana
- Existing `docker-compose.yml`, `observability/`, `docs/`, `data/`, and
  `load-tests/`

Tempo and application tracing are deferred.

## Repository structure

```text
backend/       FastAPI application, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and pytest tests
frontend/      React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, TanStack Query, MUI
observability/ Phase 0 observability configuration (unchanged)
docs/          Phase 0 and project documentation (unchanged)
```

## Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env       # optional; defaults are local-development safe
./start_backend.sh
```

The API is available at http://localhost:8050. Useful endpoints are /,
/health, /version, and the Warehouse & Fulfillment API under
/api/v1/warehouse. The health endpoint returns HTTP 503 when
PostgreSQL or Redis is unavailable.

Warehouse API endpoints:

- GET /api/v1/warehouse/summary
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/warehouses
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/warehouses/{warehouse_id}
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/items
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/inventory
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/orders
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/tasks
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/shipments
- POST /api/v1/warehouse/orders
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/orders/{order_id}
- POST /api/v1/warehouse/orders/{order_id}/allocate
- POST /api/v1/warehouse/orders/{order_id}/release-tasks
- POST /api/v1/warehouse/tasks/{task_id}/start
- POST /api/v1/warehouse/tasks/{task_id}/complete
- POST /api/v1/warehouse/orders/{order_id}/ship
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/orders/{order_id}/events
- GET /api/v1/warehouse/inventory-transactions

After applying the Alembic migrations, load deterministic demo data with:

    cd backend
    source .venv/bin/activate
    alembic upgrade head
    python -m app.db.seed_warehouse

Supported backend variables are documented in `backend/.env.example`,
including `APP_*`, `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`, `DATABASE_*`, `REDIS_*`,
`LOG_LEVEL`, and `REQUEST_ID_HEADER`.

## Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env       # optional
./start_frontend.sh
```

The frontend is served at http://localhost:4001. Its API URL and branding
variables are documented in `frontend/.env.example`.

Warehouse frontend routes:

- /warehouse
- /warehouse/inventory
- /warehouse/orders
- /warehouse/orders/new
- /warehouse/orders/:orderId
- /warehouse/tasks
- /warehouse/shipments
- /warehouse/inventory-transactions

The existing /, /health, and /about routes remain available.

## Validation

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
python -m app.db.seed_warehouse
pytest

cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current foundation boundaries
and deferred work.

## Prompt 03 workflow

```text
Customer Order → Allocation → Fulfillment Task Release → Pick → Pack
→ Shipment → Inventory Reduction → Inventory Transaction Ledger
```

The workflow tables are `wf_allocations`, `wf_inventory_transactions`, and
`wf_order_events`. The frontend provides order creation, order detail actions,
task start/complete actions, and the transaction ledger at port `4001`; the
backend remains on port `8050`.

Known deferred capabilities include returns, replenishment, wave planning,
carrier integrations, background jobs, adjustment approvals, anomaly
detection, incidents, tickets, agents, and AI behaviors.
